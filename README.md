Time-series forecasting is a statiscal method used to predict future values of a variable based on its historical data.  By analyzing past trends, patterns, and seasonality, forecasting models can make informed predictions about future outcomes.  Using Python, we can conduct statistical analysis and data science methods to transform big data to forecast future predicted values.  This is a data science project which utilizes:
- Explanatory Data Analysis
- Feature Engineering
  - Lagging Features
  - Creating Daily Mean and Daily Return
- Comparative Analysis
- Hypothesis Testing
- Lagging Features
- R2 Scoring
  - Baseline Model
  - Preprocessing Features
  - RandomForestRegressor
- Prophet Forecasting
- Auto-ARIMA
  - Time-series Decomposition
  - Autocorrelation and Partial Autocorrelation
  - Dickey-Fuller Testing
  - Hyper-Parameter Optimization
  - Model Diagnostics
-Evaluation Metrics
  - RMSE Score
 
With the use of statistical methods and the construction of our forecasting models, we have trained models that could accurately predict the stock price of highly traded stocks between the years of 2013-2018.
